"Play Windows games on Linux without trusting random executables with your system."

WineWarden is a calm, always-on protection layer for Wine, Proton, Lutris, and Steam. It is not an antivirus. It does not moralize. It exists so you can play without anxiety.

            W I N E W A R D E N  ·  calm by design
```

## What It Is

- WineWarden Mode: silent protection with no prompts during gameplay
- Trust Tiers: clear reassurance signals (Green, Yellow, Red)
- Sacred Zones: protect the places games should never need
- Prefix Hygiene: keep prefixes clean and stable over time
- Network Safety: observe without breaking multiplayer
- Pirate-Safe Mode: stronger isolation with zero judgment
- Human Reports: short, calm summaries after each run

## Why It Feels Different

- Secure by default
- Easy to relax
- Hard to break accidentally
- No popups mid-game
- No shame, no fear

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize config
winewarden init

# Run a game quietly (no prompts during gameplay)
winewarden run /path/to/game.exe -- -arg1 -arg2

# Run with a provided event log (JSONL of AccessAttempt)
winewarden run /path/to/game.exe --event-log tests/fixtures/events.jsonl --no-run

# View a report
winewarden report --input ~/.local/share/winewarden/reports/<id>.json
```

## Daemon Mode

```bash
# Start the background daemon
winewarden daemon start

# Run a game through the daemon
winewarden run --daemon /path/to/game.exe -- -arg1 -arg2

# Check daemon health
winewarden daemon ping
```

## Architecture (Separation of Concerns)

- Policy Engine: decisions only
- Monitor: observation without interruption
- Runner: safe command construction
- Prefix Manager: hygiene, snapshots, quarantine
- Reporting: human summaries and JSON
- WineWarden Daemon: background scheduling

```
   [Runner] → [Monitor] → [Policy Engine] → [Reporting]
        ↘        ↘              ↘              ↘
     [Prefix Manager]        [Trust Tiers]   [Human Reports]
```

## Configuration

Configuration is TOML and readable by design. See:

- `config/default.toml`
- `config/relaxed.toml`
- `config/pirate-safe.toml`

Variables supported:

- `${HOME}`
- `${DATA_DIR}`
- `${CONFIG_DIR}`

## Reports (Human First)

Examples of the tone you should expect:

- "This game tried to access files outside its sandbox."
- "That access was denied."
- "Your system remains intact."

## Documentation

- `docs/vision.md`
- `docs/threat-model.md`
- `docs/winewarden-mode.md`
- `docs/trust-tiers.md`
- `docs/sacred-zones.md`
- `docs/prefix-hygiene.md`
- `docs/networking.md`
- `docs/pirate-safe-mode.md`
- `docs/reports.md`
- `docs/configuration.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/glossary.md`

## Status

This is the foundation. Real enforcement hooks are designed to plug into the monitor layer without changing the calm user experience.
